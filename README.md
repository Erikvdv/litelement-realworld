# LitElement Real World app

### [Demo](https://lit-realworld.azurewebsites.net/)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)

This repository consists of two, LitElement based, versions of Real World app.

The code is written in Typescript and the build is done with Webpack.
It is using Redux for state management.

Shadow-DOM is disabled as it is relying on the external RealWorld app stylesheet.

It does support service workers, including offline access

The first app is based on redux thunk and uses Page.js for routing.

The second app is based on redux-observable. It is using typesafe-actions to simplify creation of actions.
It is using rxjs fetch for networking.
