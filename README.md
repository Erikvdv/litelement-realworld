# LitElement Real World app

This LitElement Real World app is based on [PWA Starter Kit](https://pwa-starter-kit.polymer-project.org/) sample app.

The code is written in Typescript and the build is done with Webpack. It is using Redux for state management.

Shadow-DOM is disabled as it is relying on the external RealWorld app stylesheet.

It does support service workers, including offline access
